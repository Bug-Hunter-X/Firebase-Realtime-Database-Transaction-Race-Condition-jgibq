The issue stems from an improper use of Firebase's Realtime Database transactions.  When updating multiple data points that depend on each other, a naive approach can lead to race conditions. For example, consider incrementing a counter and updating a related record simultaneously without a transaction. If two clients perform this operation concurrently, the counter might be incremented only once instead of twice.

```javascript
// Problematic code
database.ref('counter').once('value').then(snapshot => {
  let count = snapshot.val() || 0;
  count++;
  database.ref('counter').set(count);
  database.ref('records/' + someId).update({ count: count });
});
```
